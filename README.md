# Zombie Shooter
This is a game I programmed in C++ in my free time, solidifying a variety of Object Oriented Programming fundamental concepts and implementing them into a real application.

## Technical Details

### Classes
These concepts ranged from a wide diversity, including **classes to represent game components**, such as a class for the player, as well as many more classes for different components such as zombies and accessories.
**Singleton classes** and **static classes** were also incorporated to represent certain objects of which only one instance could exist, as well as 

### Pointer Implementation
**Pointers** were implemented for memory maintenance and **dynamic memory allocation**. Memory was allocated when necessary for use and deleted when no longer necessary, ensuring optimal use of memory.

I incorporated SFML classes in order to create visual displays and implement other features in the game. As for the game, feel free to clone or download the repository and play it yourself, enjoy!

## Libraries
The **SFML Library** was used for the game's development and its manny classes as well as class methods were used in the development process for a variety of areas, such as **graphics**, **audio**, and many more areas.
