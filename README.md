# Zombie Shooter
This is a game I programmed in C++ in my free time, solidifying a variety of Object Oriented Programming fundamental concepts and implementing them into a real application. 

These concepts ranged from a wide diversity, including **classes to represent game components**, such as a class for the player, as well as many more classes for different components such as zombies and accessories.
to using singleton classes, static classes, and even pointer implementation for memory maintenance and dynamic memory allocation at times, ensuring that memory is not being wasted. I incorporated SFML classes in order to create visual displays and implement other features in the game. As for the game, feel free to clone or download the repository and play it yourself, enjoy!
