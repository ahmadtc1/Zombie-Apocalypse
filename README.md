# Zombie Shooter
This is a game I programmed in C++ in my free time implementing strong Object Oriented Programming, ranging from concepts such as creating classes to represent different components of the game, to using singleton classes, static classes, and even pointer implementation for memory maintenance and dynamic memory allocation at times, ensuring that memory is not being wasted. I incorporated SFML classes in order to create visual displays and implement other features in the game. As for the game, feel free to clone or download the repository and play it yourself, enjoy!
